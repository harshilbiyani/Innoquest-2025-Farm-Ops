Farm-Ops

🧭 Project Abstract

Farm-Ops is an intelligent precision-farming ecosystem designed to empower farmers through AI-driven insights, real-time data, and multilingual accessibility. The system integrates live APIs, soil health card datasets, and weather intelligence to provide crop recommendations, fertilizer optimization, mandi price comparison, GPS-based land tracking, and government scheme guidance — all from one platform.
The solution comprises both a responsive web portal and a mobile app, ensuring accessibility for farmers, experts, and administrators alike. By merging agronomy with AI and modern software architecture, Farm-Ops aims to make sustainable, data-backed farming practices accessible to every cultivator.
