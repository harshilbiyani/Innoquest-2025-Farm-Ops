## Usage

1. User taps "Profit/Loss Calculator" from home page
2. Selects crop type (auto-fills yield and price)
3. Enters farm area and cost details
4. Optionally enters loan information
5. Taps "Calculate Profit/Loss" button

## Calculations

### Revenue

```dart
totalProduction = farmArea √ó expectedYield
totalRevenue = totalProduction √ó marketPrice
```

### Costs

```dart
operationalCosts = seedCost + fertilizerCost + pesticideCost + laborCost + otherCost
annualInterest = (loanAmount √ó interestRate) / 100
totalLoanRepayment = loanAmount + annualInterest
totalCosts = operationalCosts + totalLoanRepayment
```

### Profit Metrics

```dart
netProfit = totalRevenue - totalCosts
profitMargin = (netProfit / totalRevenue) √ó 100
roi = (netProfit / totalCosts) √ó 100
monthlyEMI = totalLoanRepayment / 12
```
