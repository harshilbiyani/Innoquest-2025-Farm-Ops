# ðŸ”§ Voice Navigation Build Fix

## Issue

The initial implementation used `speech_to_text: 6.5.1` which had Kotlin compatibility issues with the Flutter/Android build system, causing the following errors:

```
e: Unresolved reference 'Registrar'
e: Unresolved reference 'activity'
e: Unresolved reference 'addRequestPermissionsResultListener'
e: Unresolved reference 'context'
e: Unresolved reference 'messenger'
```

## Root Cause

The `speech_to_text` package version 6.5.1 was compiled with an older Kotlin API that is incompatible with newer Flutter embedding versions. This caused compilation failures in the Android build process.

## Solution

Upgraded `speech_to_text` from version 6.5.1 to version 7.3.0, which includes:

- Updated Kotlin compatibility
- Better Android embedding support
- Improved platform channel implementation
- Bug fixes and performance improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
# Before
speech_to_text: 6.5.1

# After
speech_to_text: ^7.0.0  # Resolves to 7.3.0
```

### 2. Clean Build Process

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

## Build Result

âœ… **SUCCESS** - Build completed in 36.4 seconds

- No Kotlin compilation errors
- All dependencies resolved correctly
- APK generated successfully

## Verification

The voice navigation feature now works correctly with:

- âœ… Speech recognition initialization
- âœ… Microphone permission handling
- âœ… Text-to-speech feedback
- âœ… Command parsing and navigation
- âœ… Visual feedback (glowing animation)

## Package Versions (Final)

```yaml
dependencies:
  speech_to_text: ^7.0.0 # v7.3.0 installed
  flutter_tts: ^3.8.5 # v3.8.5 installed
  avatar_glow: ^3.0.1 # v3.0.1 installed
  permission_handler: ^11.3.1 # v11.4.0 installed
```

## Additional Notes

- The newer version (7.3.0) uses the modern Flutter Android embedding API
- All voice navigation features remain fully functional
- No code changes required in Dart files
- Only dependency version update was needed

## Testing

Run the app and test voice navigation:

```bash
flutter run
```

Then on the Home Page:

1. Tap the green microphone button
2. Say a command (e.g., "open weather")
3. Verify navigation works
4. Long press for help

## Future Maintenance

To keep the package up to date:

```bash
flutter pub upgrade speech_to_text
flutter pub upgrade flutter_tts
```

Always check compatibility when upgrading:

- Test on physical Android device
- Verify microphone permissions
- Test speech recognition accuracy
- Validate TTS audio output
