## 🎯 What Still Needs Manual Review

Some pages may have:
1. **Custom text** not in common patterns
2. **Dynamic content** from API
3. **Special formatting** that couldn't be auto-translated
4. **Validation messages** in English

To find these:
1. Run the app in Hindi/Marathi
2. Navigate through each page
3. Look for English text that should be translated
4. Add those specific translations manually

## 🔧 How to Add Missing Translations

If you find English text that wasn't translated:

### Step 1: Add to localization_service.dart
```dart
// In _englishStrings map:
'your_key': 'Your English Text',

// In _hindiStrings map:
'your_key': 'आपका हिंदी पाठ',

// In _marathiStrings map:
'your_key': 'तुमचा मराठी मजकूर',
```

### Step 2: Add getter in AppLocalizations class
```dart
String get yourKey => translate('your_key');
```

### Step 3: Use in your page
```dart
Text(context.localizations.yourKey)
```
